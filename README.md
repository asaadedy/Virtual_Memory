# Virtual_Memory
The virtual memory will be responsible of virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using a two-level page table. Also, it has four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO, Clock, exact LRU, and OPT.

Compile: run the make file for executable files for each replacement algorithm

Execution: The simulator is executed as. /sim -f <tracefile> -m <memory size> -s <swapfile size> -a <replacement algorithm>
